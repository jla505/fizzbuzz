# FizzBuzz

This is a simple Python program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. For multiples of three, it prints "Fizz" instead of the number, and for multiples of five, it prints "Buzz." For numbers which are multiples of both three and five, it prints "FizzBuzz."

## Problem Statement

Write a short program that prints each number from 1 to 100 on a new line. 
- For each multiple of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number. 
- For each multiple of 5, print "Buzz" instead of the number. 
- For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.

## How to Run the Program

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
2. Copy the above code into a file named `fizzbuzz.py`.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where `fizzbuzz.py` is saved.
4. Run the program using the following command:

    ```bash
    python fizzbuzz.py
    ```

You should see the output printed in the terminal.
